# Student-Classification
The ability to predict the performance trend of students is very important to improve their teaching skills. It has become valuable knowledge that can be used for different purposes; for example, a strategic plan can be applied for the development of quality education. This project proposes the application of data mining techniques to predict students' final grades based on their historical data. In the experimental studies, three well-known data mining techniques (KNN, CART decision tree, MLP and SVM) were used on the educational datasets related to the math lesson and the Portuguese lesson. The results showed the effectiveness of data mining learning techniques in predicting student performance.
